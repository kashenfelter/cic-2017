# Presentation materials for July 2017 CIC event

- 20 July 2017 Cambridge Innovation Center, Cambridge MA

# References
The goal of this presentation was to translate and use models reported in the literature. Accordingly, we note that we were not involved in 
developing any of the models presented here, but acknowledge the authors who
not only did the scientific work, but published that work in a way that 
allowed us to not only read about their models but to also use those models.
